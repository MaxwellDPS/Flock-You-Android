## 🔐 CI/CD & Supply Chain Security

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds with full supply chain security.

### Build Attestation

All APKs (debug and release) are attested using [GitHub Artifact Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) with SLSA Build Provenance. This cryptographically proves:

- **What** was built (APK hash)
- **Where** it was built (this repository)
- **How** it was built (workflow file, commit SHA)
- **Who** triggered the build

### APK Signing Options

Release builds support three signing methods (in priority order):

| Priority | Method | Use Case | Configuration |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Production Keystore** | Play Store / production releases | Repository secrets |
| 2️⃣ | **Step CA (JWK Auth)** | Enterprise PKI / organizational signing | Step CA server + JWK provisioner |
| 3️⃣ | **Ephemeral Self-Signed** | Testing / development builds | Automatic (no config needed) |

#### Option 1: Production Keystore (Recommended for Releases)

Configure these repository secrets:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded `.jks` or `.p12` keystore |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias within the keystore |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

```bash
# Encode your keystore
base64 -i release-keystore.jks | pbcopy  # macOS
base64 -w 0 release-keystore.jks         # Linux
```

#### Option 2: Step CA with JWK Provisioner (Enterprise)

For organizations with their own [Step CA](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/) server:

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `STEP_CA_URL` | Yes | Your Step CA URL (e.g., `https://ca.example.com`) |
| `STEP_CA_ROOT_CRT` | One of these | PEM-encoded root certificate |
| `STEP_CA_FINGERPRINT` | | Root certificate fingerprint |
| `STEP_CA_JWK_PROVISIONER` | Yes | JWK provisioner name |
| `STEP_CA_JWK_KEY` | Yes | JWK private key (JSON format) |
| `STEP_CA_JWK_PASSWORD` | No | Password for encrypted JWK key |

The workflow will:
1. Bootstrap the step CLI with your CA
2. Request a certificate using the JWK provisioner
3. Include the full certificate chain in the signing keystore
4. Sign the APK with the CA-issued certificate

#### Option 3: Ephemeral Self-Signed (Default Fallback)

When no keystore or CA is configured, the workflow automatically:
1. Generates a self-signed certificate using [Smallstep CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/)
2. Creates an ephemeral RSA 2048-bit key pair
3. Signs the APK for testing purposes

> ⚠️ **Note:** Ephemeral certificates are regenerated each build. The APK will have a different signature each time, which may cause issues with Android's signature verification for updates.

### Workflow Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SLSA Attestation** | Cryptographic build provenance for all APKs |
| **Multi-method Signing** | Keystore → Step CA → Ephemeral fallback |
| **Build Summaries** | Rich job summaries with signing info and links |
| **Automated Releases** | Manual trigger with version input |
| **Parallel Jobs** | Lint and tests run alongside build |
| **Artifact Retention** | Debug (14 days), Release (90 days) |

### Triggering a Release

1. Go to **Actions** → **Android CI/CD**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enable **Create a GitHub Release**
4. Enter version (e.g., `1.2.0`)
5. Optionally mark as pre-release
6. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow will build, sign, attest, and create a GitHub Release with the APK.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **WiFi Throttling**: Android limits scans to 4 per 2-minute period
- **Background**: Battery optimization may affect scan frequency (disable for best results)
- **Range**: BLE detection ~50-100m depending on environment
- **False Positives**: MAC OUI detection may flag non-surveillance LTE devices
- **Police Tech**: Body cameras only detectable when WiFi/BLE is enabled (usually during sync)
- **Cellular Monitoring**: Anomaly detection may produce false positives in areas with poor coverage or during normal handoffs while moving. Modern IMSI catchers are increasingly difficult to detect.
- **Satellite Detection**: Requires Android 14+ and compatible hardware. NTN features depend on carrier support.
- **Ultrasonic Detection**: Requires microphone permission. Background noise may affect accuracy. Does not record audio content.
- **RF Analysis**: Drone detection relies on WiFi scanning; cannot detect RF-silent drones.
- **Rogue WiFi**: Evil twin detection requires seeing both the legitimate and rogue AP.

## 🔋 Battery Usage Notice

This application performs continuous background scanning across multiple radio interfaces (WiFi, Bluetooth LE, cellular) and sensors (microphone for ultrasonic detection). **This will significantly impact battery life.**

For optimal detection coverage:
- Disable Android's battery optimization for this app
- Expect 15-30% additional daily battery drain depending on scan settings
- Use aggressive BLE scanning only when needed
- Consider reducing scan intervals in low-risk areas

The app uses a foreground service with wake locks to maintain reliable scanning. This is necessary for consistent detection but comes at a battery cost.

## 🔐 Data Collection & Privacy

> **To detect if you're being surveilled, this app must surveil you first.**

This app collects and stores locally:
- **Location data** attached to every detection event
- **Cell tower history** with timestamps and coordinates
- **WiFi network profiles** with location mapping
- **Bluetooth device records** with signal data
- **Ultrasonic events** and RF environment data

**Database encryption**: SQLCipher with AES-256-GCM, key in Android Keystore.

**What encryption protects against**:
- Casual device theft
- Locked device extraction (mostly)

**What encryption does NOT protect against**:
- Unlocked device forensics (Cellebrite, GrayKey)
- Compelled device unlock
- Malware with app-level access

**Recommendations**:
- Use shortest retention period acceptable (Settings > Data Retention)
- Clear data before high-risk situations (border crossings, protests)
- Consider disabling features you don't need
- For OEM deployments, see [detailed security analysis](OEM_INTEGRATION.md#data-collection--the-surveillance-paradox)

**TPM/StrongBox binding** would provide marginal improvement for locked-device attacks but doesn't help when the device is unlocked (which is when the app needs to function). See [OEM Integration Guide](OEM_INTEGRATION.md#would-tpm-bound-secrets-help) for detailed analysis.

## ⚖️ Legal Notice

**For educational and research purposes only.**

This software is designed to detect the presence of surveillance equipment using publicly broadcast wireless signals. It does not interfere with, disable, or modify any surveillance equipment.

Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws in their jurisdiction.

## 🤖 Development Notice

This application was developed with significant assistance from AI coding tools (Claude). The codebase has been reviewed for security and functionality, but users should be aware of the AI-assisted development methodology.
